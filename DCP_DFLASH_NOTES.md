# DCP + tokenspeed_mla + DFlash — design notes

Branch `jamesliu/dcp-dflash`: decode context parallelism (DCP) support for the
`tokenspeed_mla` / `trtllm_mla` attention backends, plus DFlash speculative
decoding under DCP. Base: upstream main + DCP refactor PR #29365
(`layers/cp/dcp/{comm,kernels,layout,metadata,planner}.py`) + fork ports.

Companion: tokenspeed_mla wheel from branch `jamesliu/decode-lse`
(`tokenspeed_mla_decode(..., return_lse=True)` → `(output, lse)`), required at
runtime — the backend fails fast at init if the installed wheel lacks
`return_lse` when DCP is enabled.

## KV layout recap (PR #14194, unchanged)

- KV is sharded round-robin by position: `pos % dcp_size == dcp_rank` owns the
  token; physical slot = `logical_loc // dcp_size`.
- The allocator is widened: capacity `max_total_num_tokens * dcp`, page size
  `page_size * dcp`. `req_to_token` holds LOGICAL locations.
- MLA writes are rank-filtered inside `set_mla_kv_buffer` (Triton kernel does
  the owner filter + logical→physical divide). The TMA bulk-store fast path is
  bypassed under DCP; the DSA fp8-with-scales write path now asserts it is not
  used under DCP (it would bypass the filter).

## Invariants

1. **Rank-invariant block tables.** A logical page of `page_size * dcp` tokens
   maps to exactly one contiguous physical page of `page_size` tokens on every
   rank, at the SAME page index (`logical_loc // (page_size*dcp) ==
   physical_slot // page_size`), and per-rank KV is dense and position-ordered.
   So trtllm/tokenspeed block tables are built ONCE with
   `create_flashmla_kv_indices_triton` using `PAGED_SIZE = page_size * dcp`
   over the logical `req_to_token`, and are identical across ranks. Only the
   per-request KV LENGTHS passed to the kernel are rank-local
   (`get_dcp_lens`, the `start=None` owner rule). Page-count identity:
   `ceil(ceil(L/dcp)/ps) == ceil(L/(ps*dcp))`, so global-length cdiv with the
   widened page size covers every rank's local page needs exactly.
2. **`_calc_padded_blocks` reconciliation.** The TRT-LLM
   `block_num % (128/block_size)` constraint keeps the PHYSICAL `page_size`
   (the kernel sees physical pages); the cdiv over `max_seq_len` and the
   Triton index-build constraint use the LOGICAL page size.
3. **Base-2 LSE everywhere.** The tokenspeed decode kernel returns
   `lse = log2(sum_k exp(scale * q.k))` — base-2, softmax scale (including the
   folded `k_scale`) already applied, shape `[B, q_len, H]` fp32, `+inf`
   sentinel for empty rows. `cp_lse_ag_out_rs_mla` /
   `_correct_attn_cp_out_kernel` work in base-2 (`exp2`/`log2`) and treat
   `+inf`/NaN (and `-inf`, which contributes `exp2(-inf)=0`) as empty — the
   kernel LSE feeds the merge with NO base conversion.
4. **fp8 scale consistency.** `softmax_scale = layer.scaling * k_scale` and
   `output_scale = k_scale` are identical on every rank, so per-rank LSEs are
   mutually consistent for the cross-rank merge. The torch block phase of the
   verify path applies the same two scales.
5. **Residue-class block sharding at verify.** The draft block's fresh K/V is
   computed replicated on every rank (before the rank-filtered cache write);
   rank `r` attends block position `j` iff `(seq_start + j) % dcp == r`, under
   causality `q_i >= j`. This partitions block tokens exactly once across
   ranks and matches the persistent shard layout for future decode steps.

## What was changed

### 1. Decode (q_len=1) — `trtllm_mla_backend.py`, `tokenspeed_mla_backend.py`
- `TRTLLMMLADecodeMetadata` gains `dcp_local_seq_lens` /
  `dcp_max_local_seq_len` (decode) and `dcp_local_prefix_lens` /
  `dcp_max_local_prefix_len` (verify). Eager path computes them in
  `init_forward_metadata`; CUDA graphs allocate persistent buffers in
  `_init_cuda_graph_metadata` and refill them on every capture/replay in
  `_apply_cuda_graph_metadata` (invoked by
  `decode_cuda_graph_runner` replay-prep via `init_forward_metadata_out_graph`
  — same hook DFlash's `prepare_for_verify` → `load_batch` uses, so the
  overlap scheduler path participates automatically).
- `forward_decode` under DCP: q arrives all-gathered along heads
  (`attn_mqa_for_dcp_decode`, `num_local_heads * dcp` heads); the kernel runs
  with local lens + `return_lse=True` and returns
  `(out.view(-1, H*512), lse.view(-1, H))` for `cp_lse_ag_out_rs_mla`
  (out `[B,H,D]`-viewable, lse `[B,H]`).
- `_run_decode_kernel` grew `return_lse` / `causal_mask` params. Base
  (trtllm-gen) raises `NotImplementedError` for either — flashinfer's
  `trtllm_batch_decode_with_kv_cache_mla` exposes neither an LSE output nor a
  non-causal mode, so **DCP is tokenspeed-only**; the base class carries the
  shared metadata plumbing.
- tokenspeed workspace sized for `num_q_heads * dcp` (gathered heads),
  `MAX_Q_LEN=8` covers DFlash verify. q_len 5–8 with LSE is FP8-kernel-only —
  this backend is FP8-KV-only, so that's the only path.

### 2. DFlash target verify (q_len = num_draft_tokens = 8)
- `server_args._handle_dcp_validation`: CUDA + spec is allowed only for
  `DFLASH` + explicit `--attention-backend tokenspeed_mla`.
- `forward_mla.py`: the three DCP decode branches (q gather in
  `forward_absorb_prepare`, `attn_mqa_for_dcp_decode` call and
  `cp_lse_ag_out_rs_mla` merge in `forward_absorb_core`) now also cover
  `is_target_verify()`. Verify is checked BEFORE `is_extend()` (it is a
  sub-mode of extend — previously it would have fallen into the extend-DCP
  branch and crashed on the missing `attn_dcp_metadata`). Gather/merge are
  per-token and handle `bs*8` tokens unchanged.
- `TRTLLMMLABackend._forward_target_verify_dcp` — the two-phase attention:
  - (a) prefix: decode kernel, all 8 q tokens × gathered heads over the
    rank-LOCAL committed prefix (lens from PRE-draft seq_lens),
    `causal_mask=False`, `return_lse=True`. The block tokens' KV has already
    been written to the cache at this point, but local prefix lens exclude
    them (logical→physical is monotonic, so local block copies sit at
    physical positions ≥ local_prefix_len).
  - (b) block: `[bs, 8, H_gathered] × [≤2 owned kv]` masked attention in
    fp32 over the fresh `k`/`k_rope` produced by
    `mla_quantize_and_rope_for_fp8` (exactly the replicated block K, no
    re-projection or threading needed). Scores computed directly in the
    base-2 domain (`* scale * log2(e)`); value = the latent (`kv_a`);
    all-masked rows → `lse=-inf`, `out=0`.
  - (c) local merge in base-2 with max-subtraction; phase-(a) `+inf`/NaN
    sentinels normalized to `-inf` and outputs `nan_to_num`ed. Returns one
    normal partial `(out, lse)`; `forward_mla` never knows it was two-phase.
  - **Phases (b)+(c) run as ONE fused Triton kernel** —
    `dcp_verify_draft_merge` / `_dcp_verify_draft_merge_kernel` in
    `layers/cp/dcp/kernels.py`, one program per `(batch, head)` with an
    `[8, 8]` score tile and vectorized 128-wide loads over the head dim.
    The original ~25-op unfused torch chain (profiled on B200 at ~26% of
    GPU time in fp32 elementwise kernels and 3.3× the kernel-event count
    of non-DCP, per layer × 61 — roughly doubling TPOT) is preserved
    verbatim as `dcp_verify_draft_merge_torch` and selectable via
    `SGLANG_DCP_VERIFY_FUSED=0` for A/B debugging (default: fused ON).
    fp8 q/k are loaded as fp8 in-kernel and converted to fp32 at load; all
    math is fp32; per-row scalars fold into two output coefficients
    (`c_a = w_a/denom`, `c_b = w_b·output_scale/(denom·s_b)`) —
    algebraically identical to the reference. `dcp_rank`/`dcp_world_size`
    are constexpr; `seq_lens` is read on-device. Fused-vs-reference unit
    test (empty phase-a rows with `+inf`/NaN sentinels, ranks owning zero
    block positions, both-empty rows, `k_scale != 1`, fp8 q/k, CUDA-graph
    capture/replay): `test/registered/dcp/test_dcp_verify_fused_unit.py`
    (1 GPU, no server).
  - No double KV write: the cache write happened once via the rank-filtered
    `set_mla_kv_buffer`.
  - Everything is static-shape, no host reads → verify CUDA graphs capture
    fine (no eager fallback needed), in both fused and torch modes.
- `draft_extend_v2` + DCP is explicitly rejected (EAGLE-only mode; spec under
  DCP is restricted to DFLASH anyway).

### 3. DFlash draft KV under DCP — replicated
- `model_runner_kv_cache_mixin._apply_memory_pool_config`: for
  `is_draft_worker and spec_algorithm.is_dflash() and dcp_size > 1`, the
  draft's `max_total_num_tokens` (hence its MHA pool size) is widened to
  `config.max_total_num_tokens * dcp_size` — the LOGICAL allocator capacity.
  Logical locations index the draft pool directly; zero fa4 changes.
- Draft writes are NOT rank-filtered: `MHATokenToKVPool.set_kv_buffer` only
  filters via `dcp_kv_mask`, which is set in `ForwardBatch.init_new` under
  `is_hip()` only — always `None` on CUDA. The fused-KV-materialize helper and
  the worker's direct `set_kv_buffer` calls likewise write unmasked.
- `dflash_info_v2.prepare_for_decode` watermark math audited: all quantities
  (`kv_committed_len`, `kv_allocated_len`, reserved lens) are per-request
  TOKEN LENGTHS, not pool capacities; allocation goes through the shared
  widened allocator (`alloc_paged_token_slots_extend` uses the allocator's
  own widened page size). Consistent — no change needed.

### 3b. Cross-rank LSE merge: all-reduce variant (`SGLANG_DCP_MERGE_AR`)
- Motivation: per layer per decode/verify step the rs merge issues 3 exposed
  ops — fp32 LSE all-gather, Triton `correct_attn_out`, fp32
  `reduce_scatter_along_dim` — where the reduce-scatter/all-gather run as
  NCCL ring-LL kernels (~15–30us each; ~5.6 % GPU time on B200 dcp=4,
  61 layers), while the TP allreduce enjoys the custom one-shot push kernel.
- New path `cp_lse_ag_out_ar_mla` (`layers/cp/dcp/comm.py`), default via
  `SGLANG_DCP_MERGE_AR=1` (dispatcher `cp_lse_ag_out_mla`, the single
  `forward_mla.py` call site; `=0` restores the rs path for A/B):
  1. fp32 LSE all-gather unchanged (`_ag_lse`, ~12 KB).
  2. The SAME stride-driven Triton kernel (`_correct_attn_cp_out_kernel` via
     `correct_attn_out(..., new_output_layout="BHD")`) writes
     `out * factor` directly in **bf16** and in the input `[B,H,D]` layout
     (no `[H,B,D]` permutation — allreduce needs none; Triton stores
     implicitly cast fp32→bf16). Sentinel handling (NaN/+inf LSE → -inf,
     factor==0 → exact 0) is identical.
  3. One `cp_group.all_reduce(out_scaled)`. The DCP group is built by
     `init_model_parallel_group` with the default
     `use_custom_allreduce=_ENABLE_CUSTOM_ALL_REDUCE`, so it already has a
     `ca_comm` (CustomAllReduceV2 on CUDA) and the module-level
     `graph_capture` already enters `_DCP.graph_capture` — the allreduce
     dispatches to the custom one-shot/two-shot kernel when
     `inp_size <= max_size` (v2 at ws=4 on B200: 16 MB pull max, 2 MB
     one-shot-push threshold; decode 48×64×512×2 = 3 MB fits, verify bs·8
     tokens up to ~16 MB; larger sizes fall back to NCCL automatically).
  4. Slice this rank's head range and return `[local_H, B, D]` contiguous in
     the input dtype — same contract as the rs path; model code unchanged.
- Numerics: the cross-rank sum is bf16 (vs fp32 reduce-scatter). Correction
  factors are ≤ 1 and the o_proj consumer is bf16 — acceptable; the env flag
  is read per call so it stays runtime-selectable for A/B parity checks.
- Unit test: `test/registered/dcp/test_dcp_merge_ar_unit.py` — (a) 1-GPU
  Triton BHD/bf16 kernel vs torch reference incl. sentinel cases; (b) 4-GPU
  torchrun ar-vs-rs parity to bf16 tolerance (decode- and verify-shaped
  inputs, empty-shard rank included).

### 3c. q replication — kill the per-layer q all-gather (`SGLANG_DCP_REPLICATE_Q`)
- Motivation: profiled as the largest DCP collective —
  `all_gather_q_for_mla_decode` runs once per layer per decode/verify step
  (61 layers × up to ~3.5 MB bf16 at bs=6 verify on Kimi K2.6 dcp=4).
- Idea (Helix `--dcp-replicate-q-proj`): each rank already has the
  replicated `q_a` input (everything upstream of `q_b_proj` is replicated
  across TP), so give it the FULL `q_b_proj` weight and FULL `w_kc` and let
  it compute all `H_gathered = local_H * dcp` heads' absorbed q locally —
  no gather at all. Downstream unchanged: attention still returns
  gathered-head partials and `cp_lse_ag_out_mla` still slices this rank's
  heads.
- Build (`DeepseekV2AttentionMLA.build_dcp_qrep_weights`, called from
  `deepseek_weight_loader.post_load_weights` right after w_kc/w_vc are
  derived): all-gather the head-sharded ColumnParallel shards across the
  DCP group along the head/output dim. The DCP group is a CONTIGUOUS slice
  of TP ranks (`parallel_state`: `tp_group[start:start+dcp]`), so
  rank-order concat == the head order `all_gather_q_for_mla_decode`
  produces == the order the merge head-slice assumes. `post_load_weights`'
  layer loop is now `sorted(layer_ids)` because the build is a collective.
- Replicas are **bf16 always**, including under the online-FP8 patch:
  at `post_load_weights` time online-fp8 hasn't quantized `q_b_proj` yet
  (that happens later in the quant method's process_weights_after_loading),
  so the bf16 weight is gathered as-is; serialized-fp8 checkpoints are
  dequantized first (blockwise via `block_quant_dequant`, per-channel /
  per-tensor via scale multiply); fp8 `w_kc` via `w_kc.to(bf16) * w_scale`.
  The decode/verify q_b GEMM + absorb bmm at these batch sizes are cheap in
  bf16, and this keeps the path independent of the local shards' layout.
  DeepGEMM masked-bmm (`use_deep_gemm_bmm`) layers skip qrep with a warning.
- Forward (`forward_mla.forward_absorb_prepare`): `dcp_qrep` active iff the
  replicas exist ∧ decode/target-verify ∧ dcp ∧ env flag (identical mode
  gate to the gather it replaces) ∧ not fused-bmm ∧ not kv_b-LoRA. Then:
  `F.linear(q, q_b_proj_dcp)` -> split nope/rope -> bf16
  `bmm(q_nope, w_kc_dcp)` -> rope (per-position, head-independent — roping
  64 heads locally is exactly what the gathered 4×16-head q would contain;
  under the trtllm fused-rope path both variants pass un-roped q and the
  backend ropes per position) -> gather SKIPPED. Verify
  (`_forward_target_verify_dcp`) consumes the same `[tokens, H_gathered,·]`
  q via `attn_mqa_for_dcp_decode` — zero backend changes.
- CUDA-graph: pure GEMM/rope, no collectives; replicas built once at load
  (storage kept stable across RL reloads via copy_-if-same-shape).
- Numerics: same weights, same inputs; only the GEMM reduction grouping
  differs (full-K matmul vs sharded matmul + gather). Not bitwise, bf16-
  equivalent.
- **Memory price** (Kimi K2.6: q_lora 1536, 64 heads, qk_head 192, nope 128,
  kv_lora 512, 61 layers): q_b full = 1536×12288 bf16 = 36 MiB/layer,
  w_kc full = 64×128×512 bf16 = 8 MiB/layer → 44 MiB × 61 =
  **2.62 GiB extra per rank** (the local shards stay). Allocated during
  weight load, i.e. BEFORE KV-pool sizing, so mem-fraction accounting
  auto-shrinks the KV pool rather than OOMing — but at mem-fraction 0.92
  with the ~5.9 GiB draft-pool headroom precedent this is real KV capacity
  lost. `SGLANG_DCP_REPLICATE_Q=0` restores the per-layer q all-gather.
  (Possible follow-up: keep the q_b replica fp8 to halve it.)
- Unit test: `test/registered/dcp/test_dcp_qrep_unit.py` — 4-GPU torchrun
  (merge-test bootstrap): load-time weight-gather == full weight bitwise,
  replicated-vs-gathered path parity with rope, and a head-stamp ordering
  proof (head h outputs exactly h+1 in both paths).

### 4. Idle / edge paths
- IDLE: model-side gather/merge conditions exclude idle (mirrors the
  flashinfer DCP path); backend metadata build treats idle like decode
  (harmless — no real rows). All DCP ranks in a group share one batch, so
  collective participation is uniform.
- DP-attention padding backstop in `forward_decode`/`forward_extend`
  (`batch_size < forward_batch.batch_size` → re-plan) rebuilds the DCP lens
  fields because it goes through `init_forward_metadata`.
- `get_verify_buffers_to_fill_after_draft` machinery is EAGLE-worker-only;
  DFlash v2 initializes verify metadata via `prepare_for_verify` →
  `load_batch` (graph) / `init_forward_metadata` (eager), both of which run
  the new DCP lens computation.

## Known risks (GPU validation required, ranked)

1. **Zero local KV rows.** With `seq_len < dcp_size` (decode) or a short
   prefix (verify phase a), some ranks get `cache_seqs[i] == 0`. The kernel
   docs promise `+inf` LSE from the split-KV reduction's `sum==0` guard, but
   the non-split path with a zero-length row is unverified. Verify phase (a)
   sanitizes lse AND output; **plain decode does not sanitize the kernel
   output** — if the kernel emits NaN output (rather than 0) for empty rows,
   `_correct_attn_cp_out_kernel` computes `NaN * 0 = NaN`. Test with prompts
   shorter than dcp_size tokens early.
2. **Verify phase (a) with max local prefix 0** (whole batch short): the
   kernel is called with `max_seq_len` clamped to ≥1 and all-zero lens.
   Same zero-row question as above, batch-wide.
3. **fold_sq path for gathered heads.** With TP4×DCP4 on a 64-head model,
   H_gathered = 64 < 128 → `fold_sq` with q_len=8 → `q_chunk=2` folding.
   Supported per the kernel's divisibility rule, but this exact
   (H<128, q_len=8, return_lse, non-causal) combination needs a kernel-level
   smoke test.
4. **`k_scale_float` on `attn_mqa_for_dcp_decode`.** The DCP layer is a
   second `RadixAttention` with the same weight prefix as `attn_mqa`; if the
   checkpoint carries a non-unit k_scale, confirm the scale attributes are
   populated on BOTH layers (the LSE/scale consistency argument assumes the
   same `k_scale` on every rank — it is, per-layer, but must be non-default
   on the dcp layer too). Most fp8-KV deployments here use k_scale=1.0.
5. **CUDA-graph capture of the DCP collectives for TARGET_VERIFY.**
   Decode-mode DCP graphs (all_gather + reduce_scatter with symmetric memory)
   are validated upstream; the verify-mode graphs capture the identical
   collectives with 8× tokens — expected to work, unvalidated. Fallback if it
   misbehaves: skip verify graph capture when `dcp_enabled()` (decode graphs
   matter more).
6. **Non-causal + LSE prefill-phase compile.** Phase (a) uses a decode-kernel
   variant (`is_causal=False, with_lse=True`, q_len=8) that will be
   cute.compile'd on first use (~1–2 min JIT); consider pre-warming like the
   prefill kernels if the scheduler watchdog complains.
7. **`maybe_detect_oob` bounds under DCP** (pre-existing): `set_mla_kv_buffer`
   checks logical locs against the physical `size + page_size` bound; with
   `SGLANG_ENABLE_ASYNC_ASSERT` enabled this false-positives under DCP.
   Same for the flashinfer DCP path — not introduced here, not fixed here.
8. **Draft pool memory** = dcp_size × draft KV. Fine for a few-layer GQA
   draft, but check `mem-fraction-static` headroom on 4×B200 with dcp=4.
9. **bf16 all-reduce merge (`SGLANG_DCP_MERGE_AR`, default on).** The
   cross-rank sum now rounds each rank's corrected partial to bf16 before
   summing (rs summed in fp32). Expected harmless (factors ≤ 1, bf16
   consumer), but confirm accept-length/GSM8K parity with
   `SGLANG_DCP_MERGE_AR=0`. Also verify with a profiler that the dcp-group
   allreduce actually hits the CustomAllReduceV2 kernel (not NCCL fallback)
   at production batch sizes, and that verify-mode message sizes
   (bs·8·H·D·2 B) stay under the 16 MB v2 max where the win matters.

10. **q replication (`SGLANG_DCP_REPLICATE_Q`, default on).** (a) 2.62 GiB
    less KV headroom per rank on Kimi K2.6 — check pool size / throughput
    after load; (b) the load-time DCP all-gather assumes every rank calls
    `build_dcp_qrep_weights` for the same layers in the same order (loop is
    sorted; partial RL reloads with differing weight_names across ranks
    would deadlock); (c) A/B decode/verify output parity + accept length vs
    `SGLANG_DCP_REPLICATE_Q=0`, and confirm in a trace that the per-layer q
    all-gather is gone.

## GPU validation checklist

      --speculative-num-draft-tokens 8 --speculative-draft-attention-backend fa4`
- [ ] Non-spec DCP decode first (drop the speculative flags): GSM8K vs
      non-DCP tokenspeed baseline; then logprob parity.
- [ ] Short-prompt decode (< dcp_size tokens) — risk #1.
- [ ] DFlash verify: avg_spec_accept_length ≈ non-DCP baseline (a broken
      merge shows up as accept length pinned near 1).
- [ ] temp=0 output parity DCP vs non-DCP with DFLASH enabled
      (`test/registered/dcp/test_dcp_tokenspeed_dflash.py`, parity class).
- [ ] CUDA-graph on/off parity (`--disable-cuda-graph`) for both decode and
      verify to isolate graph-capture issues.
- [ ] Radix-cache prefix hits under DCP + DFlash (draft pool replication
      interacts with prefix reuse through the shared logical allocator).
- [ ] Memory: confirm draft pool widening doesn't tip mem-fraction-static.
- [ ] Merge A/B: `SGLANG_DCP_MERGE_AR=1` vs `=0` — temp=0 output parity,
      accept length, and per-layer merge latency in a trace (expect the two

- [ ] q-rep A/B: `SGLANG_DCP_REPLICATE_Q=1` vs `=0` — temp=0 output parity,
      accept length, KV pool size after load, and trace showing the
